# Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) example application

This example application shows how to use the QR code library in a WPF application:

- `QrCodeDrawing` is a class for either creating a resolution independent `DrawingVisual` or a bitmap. Both can be displayed in an `Image` control
- The control also implements copying the QR code to the clipboard.
