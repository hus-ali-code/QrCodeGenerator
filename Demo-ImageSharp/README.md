# Saving as PNG using ImageSharp

This example program shows how to create a QR code and save it as a PNG file using the [ImageSharp](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp) rasterization library.

Additionally, it demonstrates how to add an image in the center of the QR code.

The use of ImageSharp is recommended if the project already uses ImageSharp.
